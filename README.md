# Android Project
## Created during the HTML5 and CSS3 classes from 'CursoEmVideo' lessioned by teacher Gustavo Guanabara 

## What have I learned here?

- This project is a content from the second part from HTML5 and CSS3 class from <a href="https://www.cursoemvideo.com/curso/curso-html5-e-css3-modulo-2-de-5-40-horas/">CursoEmVideo</a>. 

- In this project I put everything about basics that I've learned with the previous content. Below, some stuff that I've studied to apply in the page: 

<li>
:small_blue_diamond: HTML structure;
:small_blue_diamond: Semantical HTML;
:small_blue_diamond: Responsivity;
:small_blue_diamond: Box in a Box;
:small_blue_diamond: Background image and Background Color; 
:small_blue_diamond: Menu creation;

:small_blue_diamond: Box shadow;

</li>

- In this project there are some changes in the design. I've challenged myself to make my own page with the colours and everything that I wanted to do. Enjoy!
